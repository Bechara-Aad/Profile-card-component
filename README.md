## My process

-Create intial repository commit to Git and link local repository to Github
-Breakdown the project into components
-Figure out how to built each component seperately using HTML/CSS with a mobile 1st approch
-Assemble the different components in the mobile form
-adapt the designs to fit wider screens and desktop, by adding the necessary code
-Run html/CSS file through W3 official validators, to look for any errors
-Make sure to make the last commit/ push to Github before hosting the site (ex. for free on Netlify)

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Mobile-first approach

### What I learned

A major learning during this challenge was coding for backrounds that fit different screen sizes/devices, by using and manipulating the CSS backround properties, as per the code example below

```css
body {
  background-image: url(/images/bg-pattern-top.svg),
    url(/images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg);
  background-repeat: no-repeat, no-repeat;
  background-position: top -40rem left -40rem, bottom -35rem right -40rem;
}

### Continued development

I wish to calcify my CSS skills particularly through the use of Grids and flexbox in future challenging exercises.

### Useful resources

-(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3T_Jy1CqH9k) - This video tutorial by Kevin Powell helped me in understanding how to manipulate the backgrounds specfically in dynimcally designed websites.
